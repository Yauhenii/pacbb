"""
The `bound` subpackage contains classes and methods for computing PAC-Bayes bounds.

These include:
  - Concrete implementations of bounds (e.g., KLBound, McAllisterBound).
  - General interfaces or base classes, if any, for extending new bounding approaches.

Use these bounds to certify generalization risk after training a probabilistic
neural network.
